# Procedural programming 

## Code Design and structure based on:
1 system constrains (framworks/db)
2 business logic (for users)
3 code readability (for developers)

## data(base) structured and rated based on
1 business logic 
2 UX 
2 productivity (costs per feature)

## databases most painful points 
### specifically in high-traffic/critical-data/micro-service systems)
1 Data: race-conditions/loosage (specifically when there is no sign about it e.g micro-services)
2 UX: availability
3 UX: latency 

## Technological Stack:

- monolitic/micro-service applications
- Nodejs/ExpressJS
- MongoDB/Redis
- Kafka/Redis-Stream
-
